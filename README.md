Project Overview

Core Components:
1. Music Feature Extraction - Analyze audio features (tempo, energy, valence, etc.)
2. Mood Classification - Map music features to moods
3. Weather Integration - Fetch current weather data
4. Recommendation Engine - Generate playlists based on mood + weather combinations
5. User Interface - Simple web app or CLI to interact with the system

Technical Stack Recommendations

Backend:
•  Python with libraries like:
•  spotipy (Spotify Web API)
•  scikit-learn or tensorflow for ML models
•  requests for weather API calls
•  pandas and numpy for data manipulation

Music Data:
•  Spotify Web API - Rich audio features and vast music catalog
•  Last.fm API - User listening history and music metadata
•  Million Song Dataset - For training if you need more data

Weather Data:
•  OpenWeatherMap API - Current weather and forecasts
•  WeatherAPI - Alternative weather service

ML Approaches:
•  Content-based filtering using audio features
•  Collaborative filtering for user preferences
•  Clustering to group similar songs by mood
•  Multi-label classification for mood prediction

Implementation Steps

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
•  Collect music with audio features (energy, valence, danceability, etc.)
•  Create mood labels (happy, sad, energetic, chill, etc.)
•  Collect weather-mood preference data
2. Feature Engineering
•  Map audio features to emotional dimensions
•  Create weather feature vectors (temperature, humidity, conditions)
•  Engineer combined mood-weather features
3. Model Development
•  Train mood classification model
•  Build playlist generation algorithm
•  Create weather-mood mapping system
4. Integration & Testing
•  Connect to APIs (Spotify, weather service)
•  Build recommendation pipeline
•  Test with different mood/weather combinations
